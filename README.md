This is the first version of my REST App. It DOES NOT have the response time simulation. 
Its OpenSource code:  https://github.com/justdovlet/rest-app-OpenSource

To test the app just go to https://localhost:8080/greeting on your browser or type "curl localhost:8080/greeting" in CMD/Terminal

Also supports GET parameter "name".
To check it out use https://localhost:8080/greeting?name=Dovlet or any other name
